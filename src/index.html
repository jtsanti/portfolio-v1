                <p>Hi there, I'm Justin, and I enjoy creating new things.</p>
                <p>My interest in web development was sparked back in 2020 while updating content through WYSIWYG editors at work. These were small changes at first, but it prompted me to take a chance and start taking a class or two to see if this could go somewhere. At the height of Covid, my company at the time retooled our product to produce virtual conferences for our clients and I was chosen to lead this project. What started as minor HTML and CSS tweaks through our theme editor grew into an insatiable passion for creating beautiful designs and fully-scalable web apps</p>
                <p>Now I'm looking to start my professional journey with more hands-on and practical experience.</p>
